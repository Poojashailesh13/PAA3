    "1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",

Thus, the two occurrences of a.x do not necessarily refer to the same attribute: if the right-hand side expression refers to a class attribute, the left-hand side creates a new instance attribute as the target of the assignment:"

    "3. Why does a class need to manually call a superclass&#39;s __init__ method?\n",
    "ans- The main reason for always calling base class _init__ is that base class may typically create member variable and initialize them to defaults. So if you don't call base class init, none of that code would be executed and you would end up with base class that has no member variables. "

    "ans- local (or function) scope is the code block or body of any Python function or lambda expression. This Python scope contains the names that you define inside the function. These names will only be visible from the code of the function.\n",
    "in computer programming, a function is a named section of a code that performs a specific task. This typically involves taking some input, manipulating the input and returning an output."
